This is the final layout for my WEB 210 class. The goals were as follows:
  
  1. Match the screenshot for browser widths greater than or equal to 1020px
  2. Decide and implement responsive design all the way down to the smartphone widths
  3. Make the markup accessible
  4. Use JavaScript for mobile navigation
  5. Use SEO best practices
