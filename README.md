<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This repository holds the files used to implement the web pages found at the following link: <a href="http://space.wccnet.edu/~sepolidori/web_development/web210/layouts/">http://space.wccnet.edu/~sepolidori/web_development/web210/layouts/</a></p>

<p>For layouts 1 - 4, I was provided mocks of various sizes (from desktop to mobile) and the goal was to try to match the mocks using accessible, semantic HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (where applicable). For layout 5, I was provided a single desktop mock and had to decide how to adapt it for mobile views.</p>
